Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set
On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). 
When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable 
item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 


A.	Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
Answer: 
It seems the order_amount is imbalanced in this dataset. Compare with most orders, there are few orders with huge order_amount. If it just simply uses 
Total Revenue / Number of Orders to calculate AVO, the AOV ($3145.13) will be dominated and miss leaded by the huge order_amount. Thus, I consider to 
remove the outlier (huge order_amount) records from the dataset and then recalculate the AOV with the R code in Q1 a.R. The recalculate the AOV is $293.72 
which is relatively affordable.



B.	What metric would you report for this dataset?
Answer:
For this dataset, I would like to use the payment_method data to analyze and report the structure of customer payment. The R code in Q1 b.R shows the process of 
payment method analysis. The credit card payment is 82.32% of the total payment; the debit payment is 10.27% of the total payment, the cash payment is only 7.40% 
of the total payment.



c.	What is its value?
Answer:
Knowing the payment structure of each store may help the merchants understand their customer more. The payment method reflects customers' shopping habits and 
consumption ability. It also helps to plan promotional activities and develop potential cooperation with banks and commercial institutions in the market.
